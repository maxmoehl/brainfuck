# Brainfuck interpreter

## What is brainfuck?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) says:  
> Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993
> by Urban MÃ¼ller.  
> Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of
> only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While
> it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical
> use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply
> requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

### Instructions (again thanks to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck))

## What the heck is this?

This is a brainfuck interpreter written in Go (aka GoLang), the only thing missing is the read function.

The main part is in `interpreter.go`, `cmd/brainfuck.go` parses
the command line arguments and starts execution.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement read function
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests
